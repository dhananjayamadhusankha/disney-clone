This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

- Developed a Disney+ clone using NextJS, replicating the look and feel of the popular streaming service.
- Integrated The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch and display movie and TV show data dynamically.
- Ensured responsive design and user-friendly interface for an optimal viewing experience across devices.
- Implemented features such as browsing categories, searching for titles, and viewing detailed information about each title.
- Focused on efficient data fetching and state management to ensure smooth performance.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
